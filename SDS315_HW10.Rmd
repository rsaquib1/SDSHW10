# Problem 1
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
redline <- read.csv('redlining.csv')
redline_model = lm(policies ~ minority + fire + age + income, data=redline)
get_regression_table(redline_model, conf.level = 0.95)
```
## Question
 Is there an association between the racial/ethnic composition of a ZIP code and the number of FAIR policies issued per 100 housing units in that ZIP code, after adjusting for fire risk, the age of the housing stock, and median family income?

## Approach
The approach/statistical tool used to answer the queston was a multiple linear regression to see if there's a correlation between the racial/ethnic composition of a ZIP code and how often FAIR insurance policies are used, with other factors like fire risk, old houses, and income. This approach displays how much the percentage of minorities affects the ability to get private insurance, while adjusting for other important variables.

## Results
The regression table is the evidence/results that my approach provided to answer the question. The minority variable had an association with the FAIR policies because the p-value is about .006 of a .05 significance level, therefore the association is statistically significant.The 95% confidence interval is from about 0.003 to .01, which does not include 0 and supports the conclusion that as the percentage of minorities in a ZIP code increases so does the number of FAIR policies.The fire variable had an association with the FAIR policies because the p-value is about .018 of a .05 significance level, therefore the association is statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is from about .004 to .040, which does not include 0 and supports the conclusion that as fire in a ZIP code increases so does the number of FAIR policies. The age variable did not have an association with the FAIR policies because the p-value is about 0.143 of a .05 significance level, therefore the association is statistically insignificant. The 95% confidence interval is from about-.002 to .013, which does include 0 and supports the conclusion that as the age in a ZIP code increases the number of FAIR policies does not. The income variable did not have an association with the FAIR policies because the p-value is about 0.679 of a .05 significance level, therefore the association is statistically insignificant. The 95% confidence interval is from about-.094 to .062, which does include 0 and supports the conclusion that as the income in a ZIP code increases the number of FAIR policies does not. 

## Conclusion
The study found that in areas with more minorities and higher fire risks, there are more FAIR policies, suggesting that these communities have a harder time getting private insurance. This highlights the need for actions to help these areas get better access to insurance.

# Problem 2

## Part A
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
grocery <- read.csv('groceries.csv')
avgPrices <- grocery %>%
  group_by(Store) %>%
  summarize(meanPrice = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE))
avgPrices
ggplot(avgPrices, aes(x = Store, y = meanPrice)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Store", 
       y = "Average Price ($)", 
       title = "Average Price of Products by Store",
       caption = " Average prices of grocery products by store type in Texas, highlighting cost differences influenced by store branding and location." ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Description
The plot is a bar graph is between a categorical variable (Store) on y axis and numerical variable (average price) on x axis.The store with the highest mean of price is Whole Foods of an average of about 3.99 and the store with the lowest mean is Fiesta of about 2.05.

## Part B
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
product <- grocery %>% 
  group_by(Product)%>%
  summarise(StoresSelling = n_distinct(Store,City))
 
product 

ggplot(product, aes(x = Product, y =  StoresSelling)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Number of Stores Selling the Product", 
       y = "Product", 
       title = "Availability of Products Across Stores",
       caption = "Number of distinct store-city combinations selling each product that reflect market coverage and consumer access.") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()  

```

### Description
The plot is a bar graph is between a categorical variable (Product) on y axis and numerical variable (number of stores selling the product) on x axis.The product with the highest count is Carton of Eggs and Horizon 2% Milk Carton of 16 and the product with the lowest count is Cinnamon Toast Crunch, El Milagros Tortilla Chips, Frosted Flakes, Lucky Charms,of about 2.05.

## Part C
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
grocery$Type <- factor(grocery$Type)
grocery$Type <- relevel(grocery$Type, ref = "Grocery")
newModel <- lm(Price ~ Product + Type, data = grocery)
get_regression_table(newModel) 
```

### Description 
Compared with ordinary grocery stores (like Albertsons, HEB, or Krogers), convenience stores charge somewhere between
($0.41) and ($0.92) dollars more for the same product.”

## Part D
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
price_model <- lm(Price ~ Product + Store, data = grocery)
summary(price_model)
```
### Description 
The two stores that seem to charge the highest prices is Wheatsville Food Co-Op of a positive coefficient of about .29 and Whole Foods of a positive coefficient of about .36 when comparing the same product. The two stores that seem to charge the lowest prices is Walmart of a negative coefficient of about -.99 and Kroger Fresh Fare of a negative coefficient of about -.90 when comparing the same product.

## Part E
The coefficient difference between Central Market (-0.57339) and HEB (-0.64596) is approximately 0.07257, indicating that Central Market is only about 7 cents more expensive per item compared to HEB.Whole Foods has a coefficient of +0.36416, showing it charges about 36 cents more per item than the baseline, which is significantly higher than both HEB and Central Market.
The price difference of around 7 cents between Central Market and HEB shows that Central Market is a bit more upscale but still affordable. On the other hand, Whole Foods charges about 36 cents more per item than the average, aiming at customers who prefer premium and organic products. This big price difference shows that Whole Foods is seen as a high-end store for shoppers who are willing to pay extra for special items.

## Part F
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
income_grocery <- grocery %>%
  mutate(Income10K = Income / 10000)
income_model <- lm(Price ~ Product + Income10K, data = income_grocery)
summary(income_model)
standardize_parameters(income_model)
```
### Description
Question 1: 
The coefficient for Income10K is negative (-0.014090). This indicates that as income in a ZIP code increases by $10,000, the average price of products decreases by about 1.4 cents and the model suggests that consumers in poorer ZIP codes pay slightly more for the same products compared to consumers in wealthier ZIP codes. This effect implies that lower-income areas could face higher prices. I was able to indicate this conclusion by doing a linear model for the variables Price versus Product and Income10K; however, the p-value is 0.144239 on a .05 significance level, so it is not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot cannot confidently be certain about this finding without further evidence.

Question 2:
A one-standard deviation increase in the income of a ZIP code seems to be associated with
a -.03 standard-deviation change in the price that consumers in that ZIP code expect to pay for
the same product.
